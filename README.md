# Diagnosing-Declining-Sales-and-Revenue-Leakage-in-a-Retail-E-Commerce-Company In UK

This project analyzes retail sales, profit, discount behavior, and campaign performance over a five-year period (2018–2022) using an interactive Excel dashboard. The goal is to identify revenue trends, declining categories, and potential revenue leakages to support data-driven decision-making.

🚀 Project Overview

Retail performance is strongly influenced by pricing strategy, product mix, and promotional effectiveness. This dashboard provides a high-level and drill-down view of business performance, allowing stakeholders to:

Track revenue and profit trends over time

Identify declining product categories

Evaluate the impact of discounting on profitability

Compare campaign vs non-campaign sales

Analyze seasonal and monthly sales patterns

📌 Key Metrics
Metric	Value
Total Revenue	£1,199,764
Total Profit	£967,291
Profit Margin	81%
Average Discount	15%
Period Covered	2018–2022
📊 Dashboard Highlights

The dashboard includes:

KPI Cards – Revenue, Profit, Margin, Average Discount

Revenue Trend Analysis – Year-over-year performance

Category Performance – Identification of declining categories

Discount Impact Analysis – Profit performance across discount bands

Campaign Analysis – Campaign vs normal sales comparison

Seasonality Analysis – Monthly sales trends

Interactive Filters – Year, Quarter, Category, Product, and Month

🔍 Key Insights
1. Revenue Volatility

Revenue peaked in 2021 but declined in 2022, indicating potential demand shifts or strategy gaps.

2. Declining Categories

Categories such as Toys, Stationery, and Home show consistent underperformance across multiple years.

3. Discount-Driven Risk

Higher discount bands generate volume but do not proportionally increase profit, exposing margin leakage.

4. Campaign Effectiveness

Campaign periods outperform normal sales, showing strong promotional impact but potential over-reliance.

5. Seasonal Patterns

Sales performance varies significantly by month, confirming strong seasonality.

✅ Recommendations

Reassess underperforming categories through rationalization or repositioning

Introduce discount thresholds tied to profit contribution

Optimize campaign timing and product selection

Strengthen non-campaign sales strategies to stabilize revenue

Align inventory planning with high-performing seasonal periods
